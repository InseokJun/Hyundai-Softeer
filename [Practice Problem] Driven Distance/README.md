# Compare Driven Distance 🚗

## Problem Overview 📏

Hyundai Motor Group researcher, Yeongho, is developing a program to compare the mileage of automobiles.

Given the mileage of two vehicles, A and B, as positive integers, let's compare their mileage to find out which vehicle has a greater distance traveled.

## Constraints 📏

- $0 \leq A, B \leq 100,000$


## Input Format 📏

The first line provides the driven distances of two vehicles, A and B, separated by a single space.

## Output Format 📏

Compare the driven distances and output the following on the first line:

- If A is greater than B, output A.
- If A is less than B, output B.
- If the driven distances of A and B are equal, output "same."

## Example 📏

### Example Input 1
```
3500 2000
```

### Example Output 1
```
A
```

### Example Input 2
```
1500 1800
```

### Example Output 2
```
B
```

### Example Input 3
```
5000 5000
```

### Example Output 3
```
same
```
