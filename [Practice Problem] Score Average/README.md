# Calculate Score Average ðŸŽ“

## Problem Overview ðŸ“Š

The grades of N students are given in order of student ID.    
Write a program to calculate the average of the students' grades within the given range [A, B].

## Constraints ðŸ“ˆ
- An integer $N where 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 10^6$
- An integer $K where 1 â‰¤ K â‰¤ 10^4$
- An integer $S_i where 1 â‰¤ S_i â‰¤ 100$
- Integers $A_i$ and $B_i$ where $1 â‰¤ A_i â‰¤ B_i â‰¤ N$

## Input Format ðŸ“‰

The first line contains the number of students $N$ and the number of intervals $K$.
The second line provides the grades $S_i$ of each student for $i$ ranging from $1$ to $N$.
For each i + 2 ($1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ K$) line, the i-th interval $A_i$, $B_i$ is given.

## Output Format ðŸ“š

On the i-th line, output the average grade of the i-th interval (rounded to the third decimal place).  
If the difference is within 0.01, it will be considered as the correct answer.

## Example ðŸ“–
